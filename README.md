# webgl-webworker-texture-helloworld

An experiment trying to offload texture decoding to webworkers in webgl

## Installation

bower install

Start your favorite local webserver. No fancy webpack or the like :)

Works in Firefox and Chrome. Edge currently seems to lack ImageData constructor support in workers.
